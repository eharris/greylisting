# If you have very large amounts of traffic and want to reduce the number of 
#   queries the db has to handle (and don't need these features), then these
#   wildcard checks can be disabled.  Just set them to 0 if so.
# If all are enabled, relay_ip is considered to take precedence, and is 
#   checked first.  A match there will ignore the rcpt checks.
# Also, the interpretation of the values needs some expanation. 
# If set to zero (0), No check is done is at all.
# If set to one (1), an exact match is done.
# If set to two or more (2, 3, etc), matching is performed against the
# numerically equivalent less exact values. For instance, if the relay_ip
# check is 2, then matches will be made against (eg) 203.213.199.245
# and 203.213.199.*
# In the case of sender/recipient, the domain names are truncated. So,
# a database entry of x@dept.comp.com will exact match x@dept.comp.com,

#   which should be unneccessary, but increases the fault tolerance for
#   some braindead mailers that don't check the status codes except at
#   the end of a message transaction.  It does expose a couple of 
#   liabilities, in that the blocking will only occur if the LAST recipient

# If you are pretty good about keeping your system well maintained, then it is

# This parameter determines how the milter interfaces with the libmilter

#   but if you want to run the milter on a different machine than is running 
#   sendmail, you will need to specify how to connect to that copy of 
#   sendmail by setting this to indicate the machine and port that the 
#   remote sendmail is listening for connections on with something 
#   similar to 'inet:2526@sendmail.server.org'.
# This parameter must match the S= option in the INPUT_MAIL_FILTER
#   definition in the sendmail.mc file.
# for IP connections: 	"inet:9876@localhost" may work nicely!!!

# This config option specifies where sendmail's access.db file is located.  
#   If you don't want the milter to check the access.db, just set this equal 
#   to undef.
# If enabled, the access db will be checked to see if there are matching
#   ip or address entries that should make us bypass the greylist checks.
# NOTE: These checks assume that the sendmail FEATURE(`relay_hosts_only') 
#   is not enabled.  If you do have that enabled, the checks in the milter
#   will be more permissive than you want.
#   In addition, the milter will heed entries in the access db even if
#   your sendmail configuration doesn't check certain types, so make sure
#   you don't have any entries that sendmail will ignore unless you want 
#   to suffer the consequences.
#   For more information on access db options, see:

#   also consumes a database connection, so limiting db connections and
#   memory footprint are both good reasons to set this.
# If your mail server handles a large amount of mail, you may need to 
#   increase this limit to avoid blocking, but the default limit is
