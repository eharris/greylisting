# If you have very large amounts of traffic and want to reduce the number of

#   wildcard checks can be disabled.  Just set them to 0 if so.
# If all are enabled, relay_ip is considered to take precedence, and is 
#   checked first.  A match there will ignore the rcpt checks.
# Also, the interpretation of the values needs some expanation. 
# If set to zero (0), No check is done is at all.
# If set to one (1), an exact match is done.
# If set to two or more (2, 3, etc), matching is performed against the
# numerically equivalent less exact values. For instance, if the relay_ip
# check is 2, then matches will be made against (eg) 203.213.199.245
# and 203.213.199.*
# In the case of sender/recipient, the domain names are truncated. So,
# a database entry of x@dept.comp.com will exact match x@dept.comp.com,

#   which should be unneccessary, but increases the fault tolerance for
#   some braindead mailers that don't check the status codes except at
#   the end of a message transaction.  It does expose a couple of 
#   liabilities, in that the blocking will only occur if the LAST recipient
#   in a multi-recipient message is currently blocked.  If the last

# If you are pretty good about keeping your system well maintained, then it is
