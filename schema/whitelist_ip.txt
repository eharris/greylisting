# This is a list of manual whitelist entries that have been discovered
# so far for various reasons.

# This is not meant to be a comprehensive list of all servers that should be 
# considered legitimate, merely a list of servers that for one reason or 
# another may either have some type of problem with the Greylisting method, 
# or because of a recognized need to avoid the delay that it may cause.

# These are common entries that most people using greylisting will probably 
# want to have.  If you happen to discover ones that aren't in this list, 
# or that the IP's in this list have changed, please let me know at 
# eharris@puremagic.com.

# Here's an example command to use in a mysql shell to insert 
#   a whitelist entry (assumes defaults from dbdef.sql):
# INSERT INTO relaytofrom (relay_ip, record_expires, create_time) 
#   VALUES ('127.0.0.1', '9999-12-31 23:59:59', NOW());

127.0.0.1       # Of course we don't want to delay ourselves or local users
192.168         # Don't delay our private networks either
10              # Private net (class A)
172.16          # Another private net (inidividual entries, since can't
172.17          #   do a /12 netmask easily
