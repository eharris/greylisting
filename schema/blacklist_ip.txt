# This is a list of manual blacklist entries that have been discovered
# so far as definite spammer networks with no redeeming qualities.

# Entries on this list are spammers by my own judgement.  If you don't trust
# my judgement, don't use this list.

# I maintain this list for use as blacklist entries in the greylisting
# database.  I do not use it to block hosts via the sendmail access file
# since that would not allow the greylisting code to collect delivery 
# attempts and other statistics on these hosts.

# Most of the entries in this list were added because for some reason they
# exhibited the determination to get around greylisting.  Since many are
# also on other dns blacklists, you should be able to get more complete
# blocking by using those other blacklists.

# Here's an example command to use in a mysql shell to insert 
#   a whitelist entry (assumes defaults from dbdef.sql):
# INSERT INTO relaytofrom (block_expires, record_expires, create_time, relay_ip) 
#   VALUES (NOW() + INTERVAL 1 YEAR, NOW() + INTERVAL 1 YEAR, NOW(), '0.0.0.0');
# or to make them permanent use: '9999-12-31 23:59:59'
