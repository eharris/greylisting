<h3>What is Greylisting?</h3>

<p>
Greylisting is a new method of blocking significant amounts of spam at the mailserver level, 
but without resorting to heavyweight statistical analysis or other heuristical (and error-prone)
approaches.  Consequently, implementations are fairly lightweight, and may even decrease network
traffic and processor load on your mailserver.
</p>

<p>
Greylisting relies on the fact that most spam sources do not behave in the same way as "normal" 
mail systems.  Although it is currently very effective by itself, it will perform best when it is used 
in conjunction with other forms of spam prevention.  For a detailed description of the method, see 
the <a href="whitepaper.html">Whitepaper</a>.
</p>

<p>
The term <i>Greylisting</i> is meant to describe a general method of blocking spam based on the 
behavior of the sending server, rather than the content of the messages.  
Greylisting does not refer to any particular implementation of these methods.  
Consequently, there is no single Greylisting product.  Instead, there are many products that 
incorporate some or all of the methods described here.
</p>


<h3>Do you sell spam filtering software or services?</h3>

<p>No, our fully functional example implementation is called <i>relaydelay</i> and is available for free 
from the <a href="downloads.html">Downloads page</a>.  But we are happy to accept donations if you feel
that the research and/or software provided here are valuable, and you would like to support 
our continued development.  To donate, see the <a href="credits.html">Credits page</a>.
</p>

<h3>I run a mailserver, can I use Greylisting?</h3>

<p>
Yes, there are implementations of Greylisting available for many types of mail server software.
Even if our implementation (for Sendmail) is not suitable for your environment, there are many 
others to choose from.  See the <a href="links.html">Links page</a> for links to available implementations.
</p>

<h3>Can I use Greylisting on my personal mail account?</h3>

<p>
Because Greylisting methods are designed to work at the mail server level, unless you have control of your own 
mail server, or your ISP has installed a Greylisting implementation for you, you will not be able to
take advantage of Greylisting.
</p>

<h3>Where can I get help setting up filtering based on Greylisting?</h3>

<p>
Your best bet is to join the mailing list (see the <a href="mailinglists.html">Mailing Lists page</a>) 
and ask for help there.  To avoid asking questions that have already been answered, please look
for answers in the mailing list archives first.
