<h2>Links to Implementations and Information</h2>

<p>
To contact me about this project, you may send email to me at 
<a href="mailto:eharris@puremagic.com">eharris@puremagic.com</a>.
But, if the contact concerns using software implementing the idea,
or ways of enhancing the method, the mailing lists might be more
appropriate.
</p>

<p>
If you are aware of any implementations not listed here, please contact me at 
the above email address with a url and a short description, so it can be included

</p>

<p>
S. Moonesamy has written a milter called scam-grey which uses passive OS fingerprinting to detect windows based hosts,

<h3>Exim:</h3>

<p>
Martin Dempsey has developed a Greylisting implementation for Exim 4.x.  It is available at 
<a href="http://www.digitaleveryware.com/projects/greylisting/">http://www.digitaleveryware.com/projects/greylisting/</a>
</p>

<p>

William Blunn has developed an implementation in C++ using a MySQL database backend.  
It was developed for use with Exim 4 using an ACL rule rather than local_scan() and therefore works with the 
vanilla build of Exim 4 and does not require any special patches or extensions.  But since it is implemented 
as a freestanding executable, it should be able to be used with any MTA that supports calling out to an external program. 
The implementation also includes outgoing message processing. See:
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bagley/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/bagley/</a>
</p>

<p>
Roman Festchook is also working on an implementation for Exim.  It is at
<a href="http://llab.zhitomir.net/?greylist">http://llab.zhitomir.net/?greylist</a>
</p>

<p>
Tor Slettnes has developed a python implementation that is self contained and does not depend on an external database.
It works with any version of Exim and does not require any special patches or extensions to Exim.  It is invoked via
a Exim ACL rule rather than local_scan() or other interface.  There is not yet a project page, but it is a package
in Debian.  See <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/mail/greylistd">http://packages.debian.org/unstable/mail/greylistd</a>
</p>

<p>
Marc Merlin has a new implementation using Spamassassin with Exim.  There's documentation for it at 
<a href="http://marc.merlins.org/linux/exim/files/sa-exim-cvs/README.greylisting">http://marc.merlins.org/linux/exim/files/sa-exim-cvs/README.greylisting</a>.  
The base link is <a href="http://marc.merlins.org/linux/exim/sa.html">here</a> 
and a diff is <a href="http://marc.merlins.org/linux/exim/files/sa-exim-cvs/SA-greylisting.diff">here</a>.

<h3>Greylisting Papers and Research</h3>

<p>
A group from HP Labs in Bristol produced and presented a paper at Usenix 2004 that takes some of the ideas
from Greylisting and turns it into a mail prioritization scheme.  Although some of the statistics in the
paper regarding false positives of Greylisting are significantly inflated due to neglecting to exempt the data
during the training phase from the analysis, it still presents some interesting information.
The paper is available here:
<a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2004/HPL-2004-5R1.html">http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2004/HPL-2004-5R1.html</a>
