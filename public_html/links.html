<h2>Links to Implementations and Information</h2>

<p>
To contact me about this project, you may send email to me at 
<a href="mailto:eharris@puremagic.com">eharris@puremagic.com</a>.
But, if the contact concerns using software implementing the idea,
or ways of enhancing the method, the mailing lists might be more
appropriate.
</p>

<p>
If you are aware of any implementations not listed here, please contact me at 
the above email address with a url and a short description, so it can be included
here.

<h3>Sendmail:</h3>

<p>
My (Evan Harris') example implementation (also used for the inital testing) is called relaydelay, and is
available from the <a href="downloads.html">Downloads</a> link.
</p>

<p>
Development snapshots of relaydelay are also available from cvs at 
<a href="http://cvs.puremagic.com/viewcvs/greylisting/">http://cvs.puremagic.com/viewcvs/greylisting/</a>.
</p>

<p>
Morris Maynard has written some very helpful installation instructions for the relaydelay sendmail milter.  His pages are at
<a href="http://www.maynidea.com/sendmail/relaydelay.html">http://www.maynidea.com/sendmail/relaydelay.html</a>.
</p>

<p>
Ian Ballantyne has written a very informative installation guide for the relaydelay sendmail milter.  His docs are at
<a href="http://midori.shacknet.nu/OpenSourceProjects/Setting_up_Greylisting_with_Sendmail_v1.2.html">http://midori.shacknet.nu/OpenSourceProjects/Setting_up_Greylisting_with_Sendmail_v1.2.html</a>.
</p>

<p>
Chris Paul has notes about using the example implementation under OpenBSD 3.4 at
<a href="http://www.sfobug.org/meeting_notes/chris_paul/greylist_openbsd.html">http://www.sfobug.org/meeting_notes/chris_paul/greylist_openbsd.html</a>
</p>

<p>
Emmanuel Dreyfus has written an implementation of greylisting in standalone C/sendmail 
milter that does not require perl or an external database.  
His project is at <a href="http://hcpnet.free.fr/milter-greylist/">http://hcpnet.free.fr/milter-greylist/</a>.
</p>

<p>
Anthony Howe has an alternative Sendmail C based milter that supports 
the Sendmail access database (Berkeley DB) for white-listing. Further 
details at <a href="http://www.snert.com/Software/milter-gris/">http://www.snert.com/Software/milter-gris/</a>
</p>

<p>
Also from Anthony Howe is a Sendmail C based call-back milter 
that uses Greylisting as a secondary technique for inconclusive call-backs.  Details at 
<a href="http://www.snert.com/Software/milter-sender/">http://www.snert.com/Software/milter-sender/</a>
</p>



<h3>Exim:</h3>

<p>
Martin Dempsey has developed a Greylisting implementation for Exim 4.x.  It is available at 
<a href="http://www.digitaleveryware.com/projects/greylisting/">http://www.digitaleveryware.com/projects/greylisting/</a>
</p>

<p>

William Blunn has developed an implementation in C++ using a MySQL database backend.  
It was developed for use with Exim 4 using an ACL rule rather than local_scan() and therefore works with the 
vanilla build of Exim 4 and does not require any special patches or extensions.  But since it is implemented 
as a freestanding executable, it should be able to be used with any MTA that supports calling out to an external program. 
The implementation also includes outgoing message processing. See:
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bagley/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/bagley/</a>
</p>

<p>
Roman Festchook is also working on an implementation for Exim.  It is at
<a href="http://llab.zhitomir.net/?greylist">http://llab.zhitomir.net/?greylist</a>
</p>

<p>
Tor Slettnes has developed a python implementation that is self contained and does not depend on an external database.
It works with any version of Exim and does not require any special patches or extensions to Exim.  It is invoked via
a Exim ACL rule rather than local_scan() or other interface.  There is not yet a project page, but it is a package
in Debian.  See <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/mail/greylistd">http://packages.debian.org/unstable/mail/greylistd</a>
</p>

<p>
Marc Merlin has a new implementation using Spamassassin with Exim.  There's documentation for it at 
<a href="http://marc.merlins.org/linux/exim/files/sa-exim-cvs/README.greylisting">http://marc.merlins.org/linux/exim/files/sa-exim-cvs/README.greylisting</a>.  
The base link is <a href="http://marc.merlins.org/linux/exim/sa.html">here</a> 
and a diff is <a href="http://marc.merlins.org/linux/exim/files/sa-exim-cvs/SA-greylisting.diff">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Alun Jones has created a perl filter for Exim that is in use at the University of Wales.  His page at 
<a href="http://users.aber.ac.uk/auj/spam/">http://users.aber.ac.uk/auj/spam/</a> has links to source and 
a nice Powerpoint presentation that has a graph of the method's effectiveness.
</p>

<p>
Tollef Fog Heen has an in-Exim implementation using PostgresSQL.  Information on it is at
<a href="http://raw.no/personal/blog/tech/Debian/2004-03-14-15-55_greylisting">http://raw.no/personal/blog/tech/Debian/2004-03-14-15-55_greylisting</a>
</p>

<p>An unidentified person has another implementation for Exim and Mysql, based on Tollef's implementation.  Info is at
<a href="http://theinternetco.net/projects/exim/greylist">http://theinternetco.net/projects/exim/greylist</a>
</p>


<h3>Qmail:</h3>

</p>

<p>

(among other things).  The code is at 
<a href="http://www.gtoal.com/spam/smtpfilter.c">http://www.gtoal.com/spam/smtpfilter.c</a>.  
A nice html version is <a href="http://www.gtoal.com/spam/smtpfilter.c.html">here</a>.

<a href="http://www.elwood.net/greyspamd.html">http://www.elwood.net/greyspamd.html</a>
</p>

<p>
Tor Slettnes has created a paper titled "Spam Filtering for Mail Exchangers" which covers several methods of 
spam blocking in addition to Greylisting.  The page is at 
<a href="http://slett.net/spam-filtering-for-mx/">http://slett.net/spam-filtering-for-mx/</a>
</p>


<h3>Greylisting Papers and Research</h3>

<p>
A group from HP Labs in Bristol produced and presented a paper at Usenix 2004 that takes some of the ideas
from Greylisting and turns it into a mail prioritization scheme.  Although some of the statistics in the
paper regarding false positives of Greylisting are significantly inflated due to neglecting to exempt the data
during the training phase from the analysis, it still presents some interesting information.
The paper is available here:
<a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2004/HPL-2004-5R1.html">http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2004/HPL-2004-5R1.html</a>
