# greylisting
Greylisting anti-spam method, initial reference implementation and tools.

Greylisting is an email anti-spam technique developed by Evan Harris starting around 2003.  This repository contains
the original reference proof-of-concept implementation for Sendmail along with some work-in-progress and testing tools.

While this codebase hasn't been in active development for many years, the methods used have been adapted into add-ons
for, or integrated into many other email systems, and has dramatically reduced the quantity of received email spam for
many users around the globe.  The benefits seen by systems/users employing its techniques continue to be effective even
today.

The project was previously hosted at http://projects.puremagic.com/greylisting/ and used cvs.  Along the way it was
migrated to svn, and finally to git.  The code repository now resides on Github at https://github.com/eharris/greylisting/
although there is still some documentation and links available at the original puremagic.com URL.
