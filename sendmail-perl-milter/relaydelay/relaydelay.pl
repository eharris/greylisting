#
# Description:
#   Sendmail::Milter interface for active blocking of spam using the 
#   Greylisting method.  Also incorporates some additional checks and 
#   methods for better blocking spam.
#
# References:
#   For Greylisting info, see http://projects.puremagic.com/greylisting/
#   For SMTP info, see RFC821, RFC1891, RFC1893
#
# Notes:
#   - Probably should store the mail_from and rcpt_to fields in the db in 
#     reversed character order.  This would make reporting on subdomain 
#     matches be able to be indexed.
#   - Should remove the table lock that ensures non-duplicate rows.  
#     Unfortunately, the cure is probably worse than the disease.
#
# Bugs:
#   None known.
