#
# Description:
#   Sendmail::Milter interface for active blocking of spam using the 
#   Greylisting method.  Also incorporates some additional checks and 
#   methods for better blocking spam.
#
# References:
#   For Greylisting info, see http://projects.puremagic.com/greylisting/
#   For SMTP info, see RFC821, RFC1891, RFC1893
#
# Notes:
#   - Probably should store the mail_from and rcpt_to fields in the db in 
#     reversed character order.  This would make reporting on subdomain 
#     matches be able to be indexed.
#
# Bugs:
#   None known.

#   identified by.  This must match the first parameter from the 
#   INPUT_MAIL_FILTER definition in the sendmail.mc configuration.
my $milter_filter_name = 'relaydelay';

# This parameter determines how the milter interfaces with the libmilter
#   API.  Normally, if using a milter on the same machine that is running
#   sendmail, it will be something like 'local:/var/run/relaydelay.sock', 
#   but if you want to run the milter on a different machine than is running 
#   sendmail, you will need to specify how to connect to that copy of 
#   sendmail by setting this to indicate the machine and port that the 
#   remote sendmail is listening for connections on with something 
#   similar to 'inet:2526@sendmail.server.org'.
# This parameter must match the S= option in the INPUT_MAIL_FILTER
#   definition in the sendmail.mc file.
my $milter_socket_connection = 'local:/var/run/relaydelay.sock';

# This config option specifies where sendmail's access.db file is located.  
#   If you don't want the milter to check the access.db, just set this equal 
#   to undef.
# If enabled, the access db will be checked to see if there are matching
#   ip or address entries that should make us bypass the greylist checks.
# NOTE: These checks assume that the sendmail FEATURE(`relay_hosts_only') 
#   is not enabled.  If you do have that enabled, the checks in the milter
#   will be more permissive than you want.
#   In addition, the milter will heed entries in the access db even if
#   your sendmail configuration doesn't check certain types, so make sure
#   you don't have any entries that sendmail will ignore unless you want 
#   to suffer the consequences.
#   For more information on access db options, see:
#     http://www.sendmail.org/~ca/email/doc8.12/cf/m4/anti_spam.html

#   to be a problem doing that with Sendmail::Milter), threads,
#   once created, will exist until the milter is shutdown.  Each thread
#   also consumes a database connection, so limiting db connections and
#   memory footprint are both good reasons to set this.
# If your mail server handles a large amount of mail, you may need to 
#   increase this limit to avoid blocking, but the default limit is
#   already pretty high, and should be sufficient for all but very 
#   large sites.

#   which should be unneccessary, but increases the fault tolerance for
#   some braindead mailers that don't check the status codes except at
#   the end of a message transaction.  It does expose a couple of 
#   liabilities, in that the blocking will only occur if the LAST recipient

#   should probably be enabled.
my $pass_mail_when_db_unavail = 0;

# Set this to true if you want to try to track locally originated mail

# Set this to true if you want the relaydelay milter to try to autolearn local
#   recipients and domains, and have non-primary MX's block (tempfail) mail to
#   unlearned local recipients.  This gives a mechanism for a cooperating set 
#   of mail hosts running the milter to avoid relaying (and double-bounces) 
#   for invalid recipients until at least one successful mail to that 
#   recipient has been processed by the primary MX, using the "local" mailer.
# There is no point in enabling this unless your primary MX is also the 
#   MTA that handles delivery for your domains, and you have more than one
#   MX host for some or all of the domains you handle, and they are all 
#   running the milter.
# In fact, if this is enabled and there are any rows existing in the 
#   localemail table that are in your domains, only a greylisting host

# This parameter controls how long records for local recipients live
