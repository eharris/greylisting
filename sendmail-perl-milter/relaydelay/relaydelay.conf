$milter_filter_name = 'relaydelay';

# This parameter determines how the milter interfaces with the libmilter
#   API.  Normally, if using a milter on the same machine that is running
#   sendmail, it will be something like 'local:/var/run/relaydelay.sock', 
#   but if you want to run the milter on a different machine than is running 
#   sendmail, you will need to specify how to connect to that copy of 
#   sendmail by setting this to indicate the machine and port that the 
#   remote sendmail is listening for connections on with something 
#   similar to 'inet:2526@sendmail.server.org'.
# This parameter must match the S= option in the INPUT_MAIL_FILTER
#   definition in the sendmail.mc file.
$milter_socket_connection = 'local:/var/run/relaydelay.sock';

# This config option specifies where sendmail's access.db file is located.  
#   If you don't want the milter to check the access.db, just set this equal 
#   to undef.
# If enabled, the access db will be checked to see if there are matching
#   ip or address entries that should make us bypass the greylist checks.
# NOTE: These checks assume that the sendmail FEATURE(`relay_hosts_only') 
#   is not enabled.  If you do have that enabled, the checks in the milter
#   will be more permissive than you want.
#   In addition, the milter will heed entries in the access db even if
#   your sendmail configuration doesn't check certain types, so make sure
#   you don't have any entries that sendmail will ignore unless you want 
#   to suffer the consequences.
#   For more information on access db options, see:
#     http://www.sendmail.org/~ca/email/doc8.12/cf/m4/anti_spam.html
#   For additional information, please also see the README file.

#   to be a problem doing that with Sendmail::Milter), threads,

#   also consumes a database connection, so limiting db connections and
#   memory footprint are both good reasons to set this.
# If your mail server handles a large amount of mail, you may need to 
#   increase this limit to avoid blocking, but the default limit is

#   the end of a message transaction.  It does expose a couple of 
#   liabilities, in that the blocking will only occur if the LAST recipient
