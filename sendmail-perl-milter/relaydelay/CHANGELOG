UNRELEASED -

  2003-07-09 - Uncovered a slight accounting problem in the milter that 
    caused some rows not to be expired as they should, as well as 
    incorrectly updating the passed_count.  The problem only shows itself
    if there is another MX host forwarding for a domain.  Changed the milter
    so that we do not increment the passed count if the outmailer is not
    local (if the mail will be forwarded to another host).  This will keep
    the counts of individual emails correct (rather than relay hops), and 
    will keep records stemming from mails to invalid users from being 
    upgraded to whitelisted rather than immediately expired.

  2003-07-07 - Discovered postfix normally uses <postmaster@some.domain> for 
    its envelope from address when doing SMTP callbacks.  Changed milter to 
    treat any email from postmaster@ as a callback and delay the tempfail
    until after the DATA phase.

0.02 - 
  2003-06-26 - Allowed for setting the initial delay to 0 seconds, which 
    allows new users to run in a "learning only" mode where no emails
    will be tempfailed.  Also, if the initial delay is set to a negative
    number, the first delivery attempt of unknown triplets will be failed,
    but any subsequent attempts will be allowed (within other time limits).

  2003-06-26 - Added a new table to the database definition for reporting,
    and a new script to move expired entries to the reporting table to help
    keep the active table to a minimum size (for speed).

  2003-06-26 - Added a check to avoid greylisting checks if the mail client
    is authenticated with sendmail.  Suggested by Borja Perez.
    
  2003-06-26 - Minor comment changes.  Update to whitelist_ip.txt.

  2003-06-25 - Changed defaults in relaydelay.pl and relaydelay.conf to be
    58 minutes for initial timeout, with a 5 hour window.

  2003-06-25 - Added whitelist_ip.txt file to the sources, describing IPs
    and networks that most users of a Greylisting implementation will want.

0.01 - Initial Release
