Changelog for relaydelay.pl and associated files:

UNRELEASED - 

  2003-07-07 - Discovered postfix normally uses <postmaster@some.domain> for 
    its envelope from address when doing SMTP callbacks.  Changed milter to 
    treat any email from postmaster@ as a callback and delay the tempfail
    until after the DATA phase.

0.02 - 
  2003-06-26 - Allowed for setting the initial delay to 0 seconds, which 
    allows new users to run in a "learning only" mode where no emails
    will be tempfailed.  Also, if the initial delay is set to a negative
    number, the first delivery attempt of unknown triplets will be failed,
    but any subsequent attempts will be allowed (within other time limits).

  2003-06-26 - Added a new table to the database definition for reporting,
    and a new script to move expired entries to the reporting table to help
    keep the active table to a minimum size (for speed).

  2003-06-26 - Added a check to avoid greylisting checks if the mail client
    is authenticated with sendmail.  Suggested by Borja Perez.
    
  2003-06-26 - Minor comment changes.  Update to whitelist_ip.txt.

  2003-06-25 - Changed defaults in relaydelay.pl and relaydelay.conf to be
    58 minutes for initial timeout, with a 5 hour window.

  2003-06-25 - Added whitelist_ip.txt file to the sources, describing IPs
    and networks that most users of a Greylisting implementation will want.

0.01 - Initial Release
