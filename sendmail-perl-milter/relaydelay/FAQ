Q. Why am I getting a "Inappropriate ioctl for device" error when trying to
   configure the milter to use sendmail's access db?

A. This is most likely an incompatibility between the Berkeley DB libraries
   that perl/tie/DB_File are compiled with or using, and the version that 
   sendmail's makemap program was compiled with.  Make sure that the 
   libraries/versions match, or disable the access db checking.


Q. I've customized my sendmail to use special mailers in certain cases.
   But any mail received by these mailers are bypassing the checks with
   this message: "Mail delivery is not using an smtp-like mailer.  Skipping 
   checks."

A. If you are using customized (or custom named) mailers in your sendmail
   config, then you will need to modify the milter source to include the
   names of these special mailers in the checks.  By default, only mail
   received with the "*smtp"  and "local" mailers is checked.  Add the 
   name of your mailer to the checks on $mail_mailer.


Q. When trying to run the milter, I'm getting errors like "Attempt to free 
   unreferenced scalar".

A. Several versions of Redhat and Suse shipped with non-threadsafe versions
   of the perl mysql modules.  Try upgrading to the most uptodate versions
   of the DBD mysql modules for your distrobution, or use the ones from 
   CPAN.
