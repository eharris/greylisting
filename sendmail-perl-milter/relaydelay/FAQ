Q. Why am I getting a "Inappropriate ioctl for device" error when trying to
   configure the milter to use sendmail's access db?

A. This is most likely an incompatibility between the Berkeley DB libraries
   that perl/tie/DB_File are compiled with or using, and the version that 
   sendmail's makemap program was compiled with.  Make sure that the 
   libraries/versions match, or disable the access db checking.
